# Eloquent-Javascript
Author's (Marijn Haverbeke) code explained (3rd edition) 
pdf version: (https://eloquentjavascript.net)

# Motivation 

I'm currently working through Eloquent JavaScript and the issue I've encountered is that I found it very difficult to obtain explanations on the author's code/solutions, so in this repo my goal is to understand and explain to the best of my capabilities the key sections and exercises of this book.
