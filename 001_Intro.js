// Programming is the act of constructing a program—a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.

// A programming language is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers.



/*ON PROGRAMMING*/

	/* 
		A program is many things. It is a piece of text typed by a programmer,it 
		is the directing force that makes the computer do what it does, it is data
		in the computer’s memory, yet it controls the actions performed on this same
		memory.
	*/

	/* 
		The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. 
		The great program is subdued—made simple in its complexity.
	*/


/*WHY LANGUAGE MATTERS*/

	/*
	    A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to
		talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level.

/*WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT*/

	/*	JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages 
		— every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at 
		— displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. 
		— you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

/*CODE AND WHAT TO DO WITH IT*/

	/*
		Code is the text that makes up programs.
